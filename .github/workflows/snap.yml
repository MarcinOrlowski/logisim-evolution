# Logisim-evolution nightly builder
# https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution
#
# Cron driven Github Action builder, intended to create nightly builds
# from Logisim-evolution's "develop" branch. It assumes to be invoked
# daily (once per 24 hrs) and skips building if there was no repo activity
# during last 24 hours.

  # The "pull_request" trigger is here for debugging purposes and
  # as work-around for having this worker not yet in main branch.
  # Keep it disabled once it's merged into main branch as we only
  # want "schedule" to be the trigger.
  # NOTE: remove `if` condition marked with `HACK` once merged.
