## Features ##

`Logisim-evolution` is educational software for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.
`Logisim-evolution` is [free](#license), [open-source](https://github.com/logisim-evolution),
and [cross-platform](#requirements).

Project highlights:

* easy to use circuit designer,
* logic circuit simulations,
* chronogram (to see the evolution of signals in your circuit),
* electronic board integration (schematics can be simulated on real hardware),
* VHDL components (components behavior can be specified in VHDL!),
* TCL/TK console (interfaces between the circuit and the user),
* huge library of components (LEDs, TTLs, switches, SoCs),
* supports [multiple languages](docs/docs.md#translations),
* and more!
